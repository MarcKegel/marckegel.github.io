<b>Lecture:</b> The lectures will take place at the RTG days. For details on the dates and times see <a href="https://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/115.php">here</a>. The first lecture takes place on 24. October, 10:00 - 11:30 in Kleiner Hörsaal INF 231 COS.<br>

<b>Content:</b> 

Poincar&eacute conjectured in 1904 that a manifold that has the same algebraic topology as a sphere is already a sphere. Since then the various versions of this conjecture have turned out to be the leading questions
 in geometric and differential topology. 
In the last century, most of the progress in geometric topology can in some way be traced back to an attempt to prove or disprove one version of the Poincar&eacute conjecture. Up to today a total of seven fields medals 
were awarded (or offered) for contributions that are connected to the Poincar&eacute conjecture: <br><br>

1962 to Milnor for showing that there exist exotic 7-spheres, i.e. 7-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to a 7-sphere.<br>
1966 to Smale for his proof of the topological Poincar&eacute conjecture for manifolds of dimension larger than 4.<br>
1982 to Thurston for his geometrization program of 3-manifolds.<br>
1986 to Freedman for his proof of the topological Poincar&eacute conjecture in dimension 4.<br>
1986 to Donaldson for applying gauge theory to show that there exist simple exotic 4-manifolds.<br>
1990 to Jones for the introduction of new polynomial invariants in knot theory.<br>
2006 to Perelman for the proof of the geometrization conjecture which also implies the Poincar&eacute conjecture in dimension 3.<br><br>

While some of these results are obviously extremely difficult, some others are surprisingly simple (once you get the main idea). In this series of six lectures, I will survey about the parts of these results that I understand
and also discuss some other results that were not awarded fields medals but are still very interesting.<br><br>

The lectures are intended for Ph.D. stundents of the RTG 2229 (Asymptotic Invariants and Limits of Groups and Space). But I hope to make these lectures interesting for any mathematician (from bachelor students to professors) 
interested in learning about these landmark results. I will only assume that the audience is familiar with some of the basic notions of differential topology (smooth manifolds, homotopy equivalences, diffeomorphism) and algebraic 
topology (fundamental group, homology groups) that are normally covered in an introductory course on topology. The different lectures are obviously related, but I will try my best to make every lecture as self-contained 
as possible, so that it will be possible without much problems to miss a lecture and still understand the rest (or just come to a single lecture if one is only interested in a single topic).<br><br>
