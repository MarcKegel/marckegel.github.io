<b>Content:</b> 
Contact structures are certain hyperplane fields on odd-dimensional manifolds and are in some sense opposite to foliations. (More precisely a contact structure is a maximal non-integrable hyperplane field.) 
While contact manifolds originated from theoretical physics, for example as hyperplanes in phase spaces (or more general as hyperplanes in symplectic manifolds), they also appear naturally in many areas of 
pure mathematics. In particular, the relations to the geometric topology of low-dimensional manifolds is rich and surprising. <br><br>

In this lecture, we will first discuss the basics of contact geometry in arbitrary dimension and then specialize to low-dimensions and discuss some of its applications.<br><br>

This lecture is aimed at all students with basic knowledge in topology. <br><br>


<b>Prerequisites:</b> Prerequisites are the introductory lectures (Analysis I, II and Linear Algebra I, II), basic notions from point set topology and differential topology 
(smooth manifolds, vector fields, differential forms). Results from algebraic topology 
(fundamental group, homology theory) are useful, but they are not strictly needed for the understanding of the lecture. <br><br>

<b><font color="red">Exam:</font></b> The exam will be oral and take place at the mornings of Monday, 19. July and Friday, 15. October. 
The content of the exam will be Chapters 1-8 (including Chapter 8) and the corresponding exercise sheets.<br>
<font color="red">Criterion for admission to the final examination:</font> For this lecture an admission restriction to the final examination 
is not permitted. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage you to regularly work on the exercise sheets. I recommend taking the exam if at least 
50% of the exercises have been solved correctly.
