<b>Content:</b> This is the continuation of my lecture <a href="19SSTopologie.html">Topologie I</a> from the summer term. It is aimed at the audience of that lecture and 
other interested students with a basic knowledge of topology. In this second part we will analyze CW complexes and study higher homotopy 
groups, more general homology theories and cohomology theory and discuss further applications of these theories. <br><br>

<br>

<p>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Prerequisites are the introductory lectures (Analysis I, II and Linear Algebra I, II), 
elementary algebra (groups, homomorphisms, rings, etc.), and the lecture Topology I (in particular the fundamental group and simplicial homology).<br>


<p>


<b>Exam:</b> The exam will take place at Wednesday, 4.3.2020, 09:00-11:00 in room 0'313 (RUD 26).<br>
<b><font color="red">Second exam:</b> The second exam takes places at Tuesday, 2.6.2020, online (see information above).</font><br>
Criterion for admission to the final examination: For this lecture an admission restriction to the final examination 
is unfortunately not permitted. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage you to regularly work on the exercise sheets. I recommend taking the exam if at least 
50% of the exercises have been solved correctly.

<b>Lecture notes from last semesters course on Topology I:</b><br><br>

Carolin Wengler has made the effort to format her lecture notes from the last semester lovingly with LaTeX and 
kindly made them available to me. (If you find errors, including smaller typos, please report them to me, such that I can correct them.)<br><br>

<b>Literature:</b><br><br>

For the basics from the last semester (point set topology, fundamental group and simplicial homology theory) I recommend the books by M. Armstrong and K. Jänich.

A very popular textbook on (algebraic) topology is the book by A. Hatcher. In addition, I would also like to recommend you the 
lecture notes by S. Friedl and C. Wendl, and the books by G. Bredon and A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs.<br><br>

 
<b>M. Armstrong:</b> Basic Topology, Springer, 1983.<br>
<b>G. Bredon:</b> Topology and geometry, Springer, 1993.<br>
<b>S. Friedl:</b> Lecture notes for Algebraic Topology I-IV, available online at his
<a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_I/friedl/">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs:</b> Homotopical topology, Springer, 2016.<br>
<b>A. Hatcher:</b> Algebraic topology, available online at his <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>K. Jänich:</b> Topologie, Springer, 1996.<br>
<b>C. Wendl:</b> Lecture notes for Topologie I and II, available online at his <a href="https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/Winter2018/Topologie2/">homepage</a>.<br>

<br>
<br>

Further material in supplement or parallel to the lecture:<br><br>




We did not discussed a proof of the smooth (generalized) Schoenflies theorem, since it uses differential topology and is thus not really fitting into the topic 
of this lecture. However, the proof uses a beutiful argument which is not too hard to understand. A proof can be found (apart from the original works) for 
example in:<br>
<b>A. Putman:</b> The generalized Schoenflies theorem, available online at his <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/">homepage</a>.<br> <br>

Some animations parallel to the constructions via pictures in lecture can be found here:<br>

An animation visualizing the construction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe2mnrLUYFU">Alexander's horned sphere</a>.<br>

A visualization of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKotMPGFJYk">Hopf fibration</a>. <br>

Some interesting 3D-animations (mostly fitting to last semesters topics) can be found on Neil Strickland's 
<a href="http://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/courses/MAS435/demos/">webpage</a>.<br>
For details about Boy's embedding of the real projective plane into Euclidean 3-space I suggest:<br>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq-EcQz_uU">Youtube video</a> by Jos Leys,<br>
the <a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/boy-surface/index.html">construction method</a> by Arnaud Ch&eacute;ritat, and <br>
the short <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001306p.pdf">article</a> by Robion Kirby.<br><br>

For more information about persistent homology I recommend the book by Edelsbrunner and Harer (assuming no prior knowledge in topology) and the book project by 
Polterovich, Rosen, Samvelyan and Zhang.<br>

<b>H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer:</b> Computational Topology - An Introduction, AMS, 2010.<br>
<b>L. Polterovich, D. Rosen, K. Samvelyan and J. Zhang:</b> Topological Persistence in Geometry and Analysis, available online 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwb2x0ZXJvdnxneDo1YThlMjkzYmJlOWQ4YjRj">here</a>.<br><br><br>



For further reading I suggest the above mentioned Skript by S. Friedl and the book by A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs. For information on 4-manifold the book by 
A. Scorpan is a good starting point. For more general differential topology I suggest:<br>

<b>T. Bröcker and K. Jänich:</b> Einführung in die Differentialtopologie, Springer, 1973.<br>
<b>V. Guillemin and A. Pollack:</b> Differential topology, Prentice-Hall, 1974.<br>
<b>M. Hirsch:</b> Differential topology, Springer, 1976.<br>
<b>J. Milnor:</b>Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint, The University Press of Virginia, 1965.<br>
<b>A. Scorpan:</b> The wild world of 4-manifolds, AMS, 2005.<br>
