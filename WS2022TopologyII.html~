<b>Content:</b> This is the continuation of the lecture Topology I from the summer term. It is aimed at the audience of that lecture and 
other interested students with a basic knowledge of topology. In the beginning of the course we will recall the basics on homology theory and CW-complexes and their applications 
from last semesters lecture. Then we will dualize homology theory, yielding the concept of cohomology groups. At a first glance cohomology does not carry more information than 
homology but in a closer look we will identify an additional ring structure on the cohomology groups not present in homology. We will further investigate a particularly friendly 
class of topological spaces, the so-called manifolds, spaces which are locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. For manifolds, there is the so-called Poincar&eacute; duality which 
relates homology and cohomology much closer. At the end of the lecture we will deal with higher homotopy groups and their relations to homology and cohomology. <br><br>

<br>

<p>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Prerequisites are the introductory lectures (Analysis I, II and Linear Algebra I, II), 
elementary algebra (groups, homomorphisms, rings, etc.), and the lecture Topology I (in particular the fundamental group and basics of homology theory).<br>


<p>


<b>Exam:</b> The exam will take place at Monday, 21. February 2022, 10:00-12:00, at RUD 26, 1`304.<br>
<b>Second exam:</b> The second exam will take place at Tuesday, 5. April 2022, 10:00-12:00, at RUD 26, 1`304.<br>
Criterion for admission to the final examination: For this lecture an admission restriction to the final examination 
is unfortunately not permitted. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage you to regularly work on the exercise sheets. I recommend taking the exam if at least 
50% of the exercises have been solved correctly.

<b>Literature:</b><br><br>

For the basics of topology (point set topology, fundamental group and simplicial homology theory) I recommend the books by M. Armstrong and K. Jänich.

A very popular textbook on (algebraic) topology is the book by A. Hatcher. In addition, I would also like to recommend you the 
lecture notes by S. Friedl and C. Wendl, and the books by G. Bredon and A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs.<br><br>

 
<b>M. Armstrong:</b> Basic Topology, Springer, 1983.<br>
<b>G. Bredon:</b> Topology and geometry, Springer, 1993.<br>
<b>S. Friedl:</b> Lecture notes for Algebraic Topology I-IV, available online at his
<a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_I/friedl/">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs:</b> Homotopical topology, Springer, 2016.<br>
<b>A. Hatcher:</b> Algebraic topology, available online at his <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>K. Jänich:</b> Topologie, Springer, 1996.<br>
<b>C. Wendl:</b> Lecture notes for Topologie I and II, available online at his <a href="https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/Winter2018/Topologie2/">homepage</a>.<br>

<br>
<br>

Further material in supplement or parallel to the lecture:<br><br>

Some animations parallel to the constructions via pictures in lecture can be found here:<br>
A visualization of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKotMPGFJYk">Hopf fibration</a>. <br>

Some interesting 3D-animations (mostly fitting to last semesters topics) can be found on Neil Strickland's 
<a href="http://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/courses/MAS435/demos/">webpage</a>.<br><br>

Turning a sphere inside-out: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_eversion">wikipedia</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO61D9x6lNY">youtube</a>.<br><br>



We did not discussed a proof of the smooth (generalized) Schoenflies theorem, since it uses differential topology and is thus not really fitting into the topic 
of this lecture. However, the proof uses a beautiful argument which is not too hard to understand. A proof can be found (apart from the original works) for 
example in:<br>
<b>A. Putman:</b> The generalized Schoenflies theorem, available online at his <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/">homepage</a>.<br> <br>



An animation visualizing the construction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe2mnrLUYFU">Alexander's horned sphere</a>.<br><br>




For further reading I suggest the above mentioned script by S. Friedl and the book by A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs. For information on 4-manifold the book by 
A. Scorpan is a good starting point. For more general differential topology I suggest:<br>

<b>T. Bröcker and K. Jänich:</b> Einführung in die Differentialtopologie, Springer, 1973.<br>
<b>V. Guillemin and A. Pollack:</b> Differential topology, Prentice-Hall, 1974.<br>
<b>M. Hirsch:</b> Differential topology, Springer, 1976.<br>
<b>J. Milnor:</b>Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint, The University Press of Virginia, 1965.<br>
<b>A. Scorpan:</b> The wild world of 4-manifolds, AMS, 2005.<br><br>

For the use of homology theory in applied mathematics (persistent homology) I recommend the book by Edelsbrunner and Harer (assuming no prior knowledge in topology) and the book by 
Polterovich, Rosen, Samvelyan and Zhang.<br>

<b>H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer:</b> Computational Topology - An Introduction, AMS, 2010.<br>
<b>L. Polterovich, D. Rosen, K. Samvelyan and J. Zhang:</b> Topological Persistence in Geometry and Analysis, available online 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04044">on the arXiv</a>.<br><br><br>



For details about Boy's embedding of the real projective plane into Euclidean 3-space I suggest:<br>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq-EcQz_uU">Youtube video</a> by Jos Leys,<br>
the <a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/boy-surface/index.html">construction method</a> by Arnaud Ch&eacute;ritat, and <br>
the short <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001306p.pdf">article</a> by Robion Kirby.<br><br>
