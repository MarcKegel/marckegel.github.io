<font color="red">Important:</font> Since the following trivialities are apparently not clear to everyone, I explain them here again:<br>

(1) If I do not have your e-mail address, I cannot send you any e-mails.<br>
(2) If I cannot send you e-mails, I cannot send you the exam.<br>

<b>Content:</b> This is the continuation of the lecture Topology I from the summer term. It is aimed at the audience of that lecture and 
other interested students with a basic knowledge of topology. In the beginning of the course we will recall the basics on homology theory and CW-complexes and their applications 
from last semesters lecture. Then we will dualize homology theory, yielding the concept of cohomology groups. At a first glance cohomology does not carry more information than 
homology but in a closer look we will identify an additional ring structure on the cohomology groups not present in homology. We will further investigate a particularly friendly 
class of topological spaces, the so-called manifolds, spaces which are locally homeomorphic to Euclidean space. For manifolds, there is the so-called Poincar&eacute; duality which 
relates homology and cohomology much closer. At the end of the lecture we will deal with higher homotopy groups and their relations to homology and cohomology. <br><br>

<br>

<p>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> Prerequisites are the introductory lectures (Analysis I, II and Linear Algebra I, II), 
elementary algebra (groups, homomorphisms, rings, etc.), and the lecture Topology I (in particular the fundamental group and basics of homology theory).<br>


<p>


<b>Exam:</b> The exam will take place at Monday, 01.03.2021, 9:00-12:00, online as take home exam.<br>
<b>Second exam:</b> The second exam will take place at Wednesday, 07.04.2021, 9:00-12:00, online as take home exam.<br>
Criterion for admission to the final examination: For this lecture an admission restriction to the final examination 
is unfortunately not permitted. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage you to regularly work on the exercise sheets. I recommend taking the exam if at least 
50% of the exercises have been solved correctly.

<b>Lecture notes from my course on Topology I from 2019:</b><br><br>

Carolin Wengler has made the effort to format her lecture notes lovingly with LaTeX and 
kindly made them available to me. (If you find errors, including smaller typos, please report them to me, such that I can correct them.)<br><br>

<b>Literature:</b><br><br>

For the basics of topology (point set topology, fundamental group and simplicial homology theory) I recommend the books by M. Armstrong and K. Jänich.

A very popular textbook on (algebraic) topology is the book by A. Hatcher. In addition, I would also like to recommend you the 
lecture notes by S. Friedl and C. Wendl, and the books by G. Bredon and A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs.<br><br>

 
<b>M. Armstrong:</b> Basic Topology, Springer, 1983.<br>
<b>G. Bredon:</b> Topology and geometry, Springer, 1993.<br>
<b>S. Friedl:</b> Lecture notes for Algebraic Topology I-IV, available online at his
<a href="https://www.uni-regensburg.de/Fakultaeten/nat_Fak_I/friedl/">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs:</b> Homotopical topology, Springer, 2016.<br>
<b>A. Hatcher:</b> Algebraic topology, available online at his <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">homepage</a>.<br>
<b>K. Jänich:</b> Topologie, Springer, 1996.<br>
<b>C. Wendl:</b> Lecture notes for Topologie I and II, available online at his <a href="https://www.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~wendl/Winter2018/Topologie2/">homepage</a>.<br>

<br>
<br>

Further material in supplement or parallel to the lecture:<br><br>




We did not discussed a proof of the smooth (generalized) Schoenflies theorem, since it uses differential topology and is thus not really fitting into the topic 
of this lecture. However, the proof uses a beautiful argument which is not too hard to understand. A proof can be found (apart from the original works) for 
example in:<br>
<b>A. Putman:</b> The generalized Schoenflies theorem, available online at his <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~andyp/notes/">homepage</a>.<br> <br>

Some animations parallel to the constructions via pictures in lecture can be found here:<br>

An animation visualizing the construction of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe2mnrLUYFU">Alexander's horned sphere</a>.<br>

A visualization of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKotMPGFJYk">Hopf fibration</a>. <br>

Some interesting 3D-animations (mostly fitting to last semesters topics) can be found on Neil Strickland's 
<a href="http://neil-strickland.staff.shef.ac.uk/courses/MAS435/demos/">webpage</a>.<br><br>

For further reading I suggest the above mentioned script by S. Friedl and the book by A. Fomenko and D. Fuchs. For information on 4-manifold the book by 
A. Scorpan is a good starting point. For more general differential topology I suggest:<br>

<b>T. Bröcker and K. Jänich:</b> Einführung in die Differentialtopologie, Springer, 1973.<br>
<b>V. Guillemin and A. Pollack:</b> Differential topology, Prentice-Hall, 1974.<br>
<b>M. Hirsch:</b> Differential topology, Springer, 1976.<br>
<b>J. Milnor:</b>Topology from the Differentiable Viewpoint, The University Press of Virginia, 1965.<br>
<b>A. Scorpan:</b> The wild world of 4-manifolds, AMS, 2005.<br><br>

For the use of homology theory in applied mathematics (persistent homology) I recommend the book by Edelsbrunner and Harer (assuming no prior knowledge in topology) and the book project by 
Polterovich, Rosen, Samvelyan and Zhang.<br>

<b>H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer:</b> Computational Topology - An Introduction, AMS, 2010.<br>
<b>L. Polterovich, D. Rosen, K. Samvelyan and J. Zhang:</b> Topological Persistence in Geometry and Analysis, available online 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxwb2x0ZXJvdnxneDo1YThlMjkzYmJlOWQ4YjRj">here</a>.<br><br><br>

For details about Boy's embedding of the real projective plane into Euclidean 3-space I suggest:<br>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiq-EcQz_uU">Youtube video</a> by Jos Leys,<br>
the <a href="https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/~cheritat/boy-surface/index.html">construction method</a> by Arnaud Ch&eacute;ritat, and <br>
the short <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200710/tx071001306p.pdf">article</a> by Robion Kirby.<br><br>
