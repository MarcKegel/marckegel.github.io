<b>Content:</b> 
The goal of Kirby calculus, named after the American mathematician Robion Kirby, is to study smooth compact 4-manifolds by splitting them into simple pieces. This 
simple pieces, so-called handles, are (after smoothing the corners) all diffeomorphic to 4-balls. All information about the original 4-manifold is therefore contained in the 
gluing maps of these simple pieces. <br><br>

First we will examine the same procedure in three dimensions. This will then lead to the notion of a Heegaard diagram of a 3-manifold, a 2-dimensional diagram, 
in which all the information of the 3-manifold is encoded.<br><br>

One dimension higher we will display all the information of a smooth compact 4-manifold (or its 3-dimensional boundary) in a so-called Kirby diagram. The term
Kirby calculus is then generally used to describe the modifications of such diagrams that do not change the diffeomorphism type of the corresponding 4-manifolds (or their 3-dimensional 
boundaries).<br><br>

This lecture is aimed at all students of mathematics with basic knowledge in topology and can also be used as preparation for a 
thesis in the field of topology. <br><br>


<b>Prerequisites:</b> Prerequisites are the introductory lectures (Analysis I, II and Linear Algebra I, II) and basic notions from point set topology (covered in the module Topology I). Results from algebraic topology 
(fundamental group, homology theory) and differential topology are useful, but they are not needed for the understanding of the lecture. <br><br>

<b><font color="red">Exam:</font></b> The exam will be oral and take place at the mornings of Monday, 19. July and Friday, 15. October. 
The content of the exam will be Chapters 1-8 (including Chapter 8) and the corresponding exercise sheets.<br>
<font color="red">Criterion for admission to the final examination:</font> For this lecture an admission restriction to the final examination 
is not permitted. Nevertheless, I would like to encourage you to regularly work on the exercise sheets. I recommend taking the exam if at least 
50% of the exercises have been solved correctly.
