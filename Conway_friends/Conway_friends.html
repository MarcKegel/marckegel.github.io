<b>Notebooks:</b><br>
The proof of Theorem 1.2 and 1.3 is contained in the <a href="Friends of the Conway knot.html">this notebook</a>. It also contains additional computations of invariants and data.<br>
The computation of the Khovanov homology and its values can be accessed <a href="KH_of_K.pdf">here</a>. Note that the input diagram differs by some Reidemeister moves from the diagram in the above notebook.
 This is because the computation for the other diagram was not terminating. <br>
