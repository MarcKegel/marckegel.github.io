<b>Knots that share four surgeries</b>,<br>

<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13168">arXiv:2505.13168</a> (May 2025).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> Distinct knots K, K' can sometimes share a common p/q-framed Dehn surgery. A folk conjecture held that for a fixed pair of knots, this can occur for at most one value of p/q. We disprove this conjecture by constructing pairs of distinct knots K, K' that have common Dehn surgeries for four distinct slopes. We also construct non-isotopic Legendrian knots K, K' that have contactomorphic contact (+1)- and (-1)-surgeries, disproving an analogous conjecture in contact geometry.

<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05032">arXiv:2504.05032</a> (April 2025).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We classify all contact projective spaces with contact surgery number one. In particular, this implies that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on the real projective 3-space which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere.
Large parts of our proofs deal with a detailed analysis of Gompf's Gamma-invariant of tangential 2-plane fields on 3-manifolds. From our main result we also deduce that the Gamma-invariant of a tangential 2-plane field on the real projective 3-space only depends on its d3-invariant.

<b>Knots not detected by any trace</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14172">arXiv:2503.14172</a> (March 2025).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> The first and last named authors have demonstrated the existence of knots for which every integral slope is non-characterizing. In this short note, we extend this result in two ways. There exists a knot that shares for every integer n the same n-trace with infinitely many mutually distinct knots. Moreover, every knot is concordant to a knot that is not detected by any of its traces.

<b>Algorithms in 4-manifold topology</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08775">arXiv:2411.08775</a> (November 2024).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We show that there exists an algorithm that takes as input two closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifolds and decides whether or not these 4-manifolds are homeomorphic. In particular, we explain in detail how closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifolds can be naturally represented by a Kirby diagram consisting only of 2-handles. This representation is used as input for our algorithm. Along the way, we develop an algorithm to compute the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant of a closed, simply connected, topological 4-manifold from any of its Kirby diagrams and describe an algorithm that decides whether or not two intersection forms are isometric.<br>
In a slightly different direction, we discuss the decidability of the stable classification of smooth manifolds with more general fundamental groups. Here we show that there exists an algorithm that takes as input two closed, oriented, smooth 4-manifolds with fundamental groups isomorphic to a finite group with cyclic Sylow 2-subgroup, an infinite cyclic group, or a group of geometric dimension at most 3 (in the latter case we additionally assume that the universal covers of both 4-manifolds are not spin), and decides whether or not these two 4-manifolds are orientation-preserving stably diffeomorphic.

<b>The search for alternating surgeries</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09842">arXiv:2409.09842</a> (September 2024).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> Surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere is said to be an alternating surgery if it yields the double branched cover of an alternating link. The main theoretical contribution is to show that the set of alternating surgery slopes is algorithmically computable and to establish several structural results. Furthermore, we calculate the set of alternating surgery slopes for many examples of knots, including all hyperbolic knots in the SnapPy census. These examples exhibit several interesting phenomena including strongly invertible knots with a unique alternating surgery and asymmetric knots with two alternating surgery slopes. We also establish upper bounds on the set of alternating surgeries, showing that an alternating surgery slope on a hyperbolic knot satisfies |p/q|<span>&#8804;</span>3g(K)+4. Notably, this bound applies to lens space surgeries, thereby strengthening the known genus bounds from the conjecture of Goda and Teragaito.

<b>Quasi-alternating surgeries</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09839">arXiv:2409.09839</a> (September 2024).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> In this article, we explore phenomena relating to quasi-alternating surgeries on knots, where a quasi-alternating surgery on a knot is a Dehn surgery yielding the double branched cover of a quasi-alternating link. Since the double branched cover of a quasi-alternating link is an L-space, quasi-alternating surgeries are special examples of L-space surgeries.<br>
We show that all SnapPy census L-space knots admit quasi-alternating surgeries except for the knots t09847 and o9_30634 which both do not have any quasi-alternating surgeries. In particular, this finishes Dunfield's classification of the L-space knots among all SnapPy census knots. In addition, we show that all asymmetric census L-space knots have exactly two quasi-alternating slopes that are consecutive integers. Similar behavior is observed for some of the Baker-Luecke asymmetric L-space knots.<br>
We also classify the quasi-alternating surgeries on torus knots and explore briefly the notion of formal L-space surgeries. This allows us to give examples of asymmetric formal L-spaces.

<b>Contact surgery numbers of Sigma(2,3,11) and L(4m+3,4)</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18177">arXiv:2404.18177</a> (April 2024).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on the Brieskorn sphere Sigma(2,3,11) with both orientations. We conclude that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on each of the above manifolds which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere. We further prove similar results for some lens spaces: We classify all contact structures with contact surgery number one on lens spaces of the form L(4m+3,4). Along the way, we present an algorithm and a formula for computing the Euler class of a contact structure from a general rational contact surgery description and classify which rational surgeries along Legendrian unknots are tight and which ones are overtwisted.

<b>On a volume invariant of 3-manifolds</b>,<br>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04839">arXiv:2402.04839</a> (February 2024).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper investigates a real-valued topological invariant of 3-manifolds called topological volume. For a given 3-manifold M it is defined as the smallest volume of the complement of a (possibly empty) hyperbolic link in M. Various refinements of this invariant are given, asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds are determined, and all non-hyperbolic closed 3-manifolds with topological volume of at most 3.07 are classified. Moreover, it is shown that for all but finitely many lens spaces, the volume minimiser is obtained by Dehn filling one of the cusps of the complement of the Whitehead link or its sister manifold.

<b>Complexity of equal 0-surgeries</b>,<br>

<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06015">arXiv:2401.06015</a> (January 2024, revised April 2025).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We say that two knots are friends if they share the same 0-surgery. Two friends with different sliceness status would provide a counterexample to the 4-dimensional smooth Poincar√© conjecture. Here we create a census of all friends with small crossing numbers c and tetrahedral complexities t, and compute their smooth 4-genera. In particular, we compute the minimum of c(K)+c(K') and of t(K)+t(K') among all friends K and K'. Along the way, we classify all 0-surgeries of knots of at most 15 crossings.
Moreover, we determine for many friends in our census if their traces are equivalent or not. For that, we develop a new obstruction for two traces being homeomorphic coming from symmetry-exceptional slopes of hyperbolic knots. This is enough to also determine the minimum value of c(K)+c(K') among all friends K and K' whose traces are not homeomorphic.

<li> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13613">arXiv:2304.13613</a> (April 2023).<br>
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We determine the structure of the Khovanov homology groups in homological grading 1 of positive links. More concretely, we show that the first Khovanov homology 
is supported in a single quantum grading determined by the Seifert genus of the link, where the group is free abelian and of rank determined by the Seifert graph of any of its positive 
link diagrams. In particular, for a positive link, the first Khovanov homology is vanishing if and only if the link is fibered. Moreover, we extend these results to (p,q)-cables of positive 
knots whenever q&ge;p. We also show that several infinite families of Heegaard Floer L-space knots have vanishing first Khovanov homology. This suggests a possible extension of our results to L-space knots.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We present two examples of strongly invertible L-space knots whose surgeries are never the double branched cover of a Khovanov thin link in the 3-sphere. Consequently, these knots provide counterexamples to a conjectural characterization of strongly invertible L-space knots due to Watson. We also discuss other exceptional properties of these two knots, for example, these two L-space knots have formal semigroups that are actual semigroups.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> The unknotting number u and the genus g of braid positive knots are equal, as shown by Rudolph. We prove the stronger statement that any positive braid diagram of a genus g knot contains g crossings, such that changing them produces a diagram of the trivial knot. Then, we turn to unknotting the more general class of fibered positive knots, for which u=g was conjectured by Stoimenow. We prove that the known ways to unknot braid positive knots do not generalize to fibered positive knots. Namely, we prove that there are fibered positive knots that cannot be unknotted optimally along fibered positive knots; there are fibered positive knots that do not arise as trefoil plumbings; and there are positive diagrams of fibered positive knots of genus g that do not contain g crossings, such that changing them produces a diagram of the trivial knot. In fact, we conjecture that one of our examples is a counterexample to Stoimenow's conjecture.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We describe an algorithm that takes as input an open book decomposition of a closed oriented 4-manifold and outputs an explicit trisection diagram of that 4-manifold. 
Moreover, a slight variation of this algorithm also works for open books on manifolds with non-empty boundary and for 3-manifold bundles over the circle. 
We apply this algorithm to several simple open books, demonstrate that it is compatible with various topological constructions, and argue that it generalizes and unifies several previously known constructions.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We show that there exists an infinite family of pairwise non-isotopic Legendrian knots in the standard contact 3-sphere whose Stein traces are equivalent. 
This is the first example of such phenomenon. Different constructions are developed in the article, including a contact annulus twist, explicit Weinstein handlebody equivalences, 
and a discussion on dualizable patterns in the contact setting. These constructions can be used to systematically construct distinct Legendrian knots in the standard contact 3-sphere 
with contactomorphic (-1)-surgeries and, in many cases, equivalent Stein traces. In addition, we also discuss characterizing slopes and provide results in the opposite direction, i.e. 
describe cases in which the Stein trace, or the contactomorphism type of an r-surgery, uniquely determines the Legendrian isotopy type.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> It is known that any contact 3-manifold can be obtained by rational contact Dehn surgery along a Legendrian link L in the standard tight contact 3-sphere. 
We define and study various versions of contact surgery numbers, the minimal number of components of a surgery link L describing a given contact 3-manifold under consideration. <br>
In the first part of the paper, we relate contact surgery numbers to other invariants in terms of various inequalities. 
In particular, we show that the contact surgery number of a contact manifold is bounded from above by the topological surgery number of the underlying topological manifold plus three. <br>
In the second part, we compute contact surgery numbers of all contact structures on the 3-sphere. Moreover, we completely classify the contact structures with contact surgery number one 
on S&sup1xS&sup2, the Poincar&eacute; homology sphere, and the Brieskorn sphere &Sigma;(2,3,7). We conclude that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on each of the above manifolds which 
cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere. We further obtain results for the 3-torus and lens spaces. <br>
As one ingredient of the 
proofs of the above results we generalize computations of the homotopical invariants of contact structures to contact surgeries with more general surgery coefficients which might be of independent interest.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> In every Engel manifold we construct an infinite family of pairwise non-isotopic transverse tori that are all smoothly isotopic. 
To distinguish the transverse tori in the family we introduce a homological invariant of transverse tori that is similar to the self-linking number for transverse knots in contact 3-manifolds. 
Analogous results are presented for Legendrian tori in even contact 4-manifolds.

The normalized HOMFLY polynomial of o9_30634, when suitably normalized is not positive, failing a condition of Ito for braid positive knots.<br>
We generalize this knot to a 1-parameter family of hyperbolic L-space knots that might not be braid positive. 
Nevertheless, as pointed out by Teragaito, this family yields the first examples of hyperbolic L-space knots whose formal semigroups are actual semigroups, answering a question of Wang. 
Furthermore, the roots of the Alexander polynomials of these knots are all roots of unity, disproving a conjecture of Li-Ni.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> A Reeb flow on a contact manifold is called Besse if all its orbits are periodic, possibly with different periods. We characterize contact manifolds whose Reeb flows are Besse as principal 
S&sup1;-orbibundles over integral symplectic orbifolds satisfying some cohomological condition. Apart from the cohomological condition this statement appears in the work of Boyer and Galicki in the language of 
Sasakian geometry. We illustrate some non-commonly dealt with perspective on orbifolds in a proof of the above result without referring to additional structures. More precisely, we work with orbifolds as 
quotients of manifolds by smooth Lie group actions with finite stabilizer groups. By introducing all relevant orbifold notions in this equivariant way we avoid patching constructions with orbifold charts.
As an application, and building on work by Cristofaro-Gardiner&ndash;Mazzucchelli, we deduce a complete classification of closed Besse contact 3-manifolds up to strict contactomorphism.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> This paper introduces techniques for computing a variety of numerical invariants associated to a Legendrian knot in 
a contact manifold presented by an open book with a Morse structure. Such a Legendrian knot admits a front projection to the boundary of a 
regular neighborhood of the binding. From this front projection, we compute the rotation number for any null-homologous Legendrian knot as 
a count of oriented cusps and linking or intersection numbers; in the case that the manifold has non-trivial second homology, we can recover 
the rotation number with respect to a Seifert surface in any homology class. We also provide explicit formulas for computing the necessary 
intersection numbers from the front projection, and we compute the Euler class of the contact structure supported by the open book. Finally, 
we introduce a notion of Lagrangian projection and compute the classical invariants of a null-homologous Legendrian knot from its projection 
to a fixed page.

<li> <b>Abstract:</b> We study cosmetic contact surgeries along transverse knots in the standard contact 3-sphere, i.e. contact surgeries that yield again the standard contact 3-sphere. 
The main result is that we can exclude non-trivial cosmetic contact surgeries (in sufficiently small tubular neighborhoods) along all transverse knots not isotopic to the transverse unknot with self-linking number -1.<br>
As a corollary it follows that every transverse knot in the standard contact 3-sphere is determined by the contactomorphism type of any sufficiently big exterior. 
Moreover, we give counterexamples to this for transverse links in the standard contact 3-sphere and for transverse knots in general contact manifolds.

<li> <a href="Publications/Doktorarbeit.pdf">pdf</a>, 128 pages. (This version differs slightly from the published version, since I have corrected a few mistake in it.)
<li> <b>Abstract:</b> The famous knot complement theorem by Gordon and Luecke states that two knots in the 3-sphere are equivalent if and only if their complements are homeomorphic. 
By contrast, this does not hold for links in the 3-sphere or for knots in general 3-manifolds.<br>
In this thesis the same questions are studied for Legendrian and transverse knots and links. The main results are that Legendrian as well as transverse knots in the 3-sphere with the 
unique tight contact structure are equivalent if and only if their e
xteriors are contactomorphic, where the exteriors of the transverse knots have to be sufficiently large. I will also 
present Legendrian links in the tight contact 3-sphere and Legendrian knots in general contact manifolds that are not determined by their exteriors.<br>
It will turn out that these questions are closely related to the existence of cosmetic contact surgeries, i.e. contact surgeries that do not change the contact manifold. These are 
studied with new formulas for computing the classical invariants of Legendrian and transverse knots in the complements of surgery links.<br>
Another application of cosmetic contact surgeries is that one can switch the crossing type of a given Legendrian or transverse knot by contact surgery without changing the contact 
manifold. It follows that every Legendrian or transverse knot admits a contact surgery description to an unknot. This yields connections of the classical invariants of Legendrian and 
transverse knots to the unknotting information of the underlying topological knot type.
